  cohort_id:
    description: "Cohort identifier. For study-defined or beacon-defined cohorts this field is set by the implementer. For ´user-defined´ this unique identifier could be generated upon the query that defined the cohort, but could be later edited by the user."
    type: string
    examples:
      - cohort-T2D-2010

  cohort_name:
    description: "Name of the cohort. For user-defined this field could be generated upon the query, e.g. a value that is a concatenationor some representation of the user query."
    type: string
    examples:
      - Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium
      - GCAT Genomes for Life

  cohort_type:
    description: "Cohort type by its definition. If a cohort is declared ´study-defined´ or ´beacon-defined´ criteria are to be entered in cohort_inclusion_criteria; if a cohort is declared ‘user-defined' cohort_inclusion_criteria could be automatically populated from the parameters used to perform the query."
    enum:
      - study-defined
      - beacon-defined
      - user-defined
    default: beacon-defined

  cohort_size:
    description: "Count of unique Individuals in cohort (individuals meeting criteria for ´user-defined´ cohorts). If not previously known, it could be calculated by counting the individuals in the cohort."
    type: integer
    examples:
      - 14765
      - 20000

  cohort_design:
    description: "Cohort type by its design. A plan specification comprised of protocols (which may specify how and what kinds of data will be gathered) that are executed as part of an investigation and is realized during a study design execution. Value from Ontologized MIABIS (OMIABIS) Study design ontology term tree (OBI:0500000)."
