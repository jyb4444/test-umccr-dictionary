description: "This element represents a block of time in which the dosage of a medication was constant. For example, to represent a period of 30 mg twice a day for an interval of 10 days, we would use a Quantity element to represent the individual 30 mg dose, and OntologyClass element to represent twice a day, and an Interval element to represent the 10-day interval.
